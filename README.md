# 🧠📸 Image Classification AI

A simple image classification AI using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.  
This project trains a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** on the **CIFAR-10** dataset to classify images into 10 categories.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📥 Loads and preprocesses the **CIFAR-10** dataset
- 🧠 Builds and trains a **CNN** model
- 📊 Evaluates model accuracy on test data
- 🖼️ Visualizes sample images and predictions
- 💾 Saves the trained model for future use

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- 🐍 Python 3.7 or higher  
- 🧪 TensorFlow  
- 📦 Numpy, Matplotlib

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

▶️ Run the main script to train and evaluate the model:

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

This project uses the **CIFAR-10** dataset — a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.  
It will be automatically downloaded the first time you run the script.

---

## 📈 Results

- 📷 **Sample Images:** The script displays 10 random images from the dataset with their labels.
- 📉 **Training Curves:** Training and validation accuracy/loss are plotted after training.
- 🤖 **Prediction Example:** See a sample prediction with both the predicted and true class.
