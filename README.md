# Image Classification AI

This project is a simple image classification AI using TensorFlow and Keras. It trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset to classify images into 10 categories.

## Features
- Loads and preprocesses the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Builds and trains a CNN model
- Evaluates model accuracy on test data

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow

Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the main script to train and evaluate the model:
```
python main.py
```

## Dataset
This project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is automatically downloaded by TensorFlow.

## License
This project is for educational and portfolio purposes.
